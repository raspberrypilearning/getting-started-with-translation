## Recognition scheme

We do our best to show appreciation to our amazing volunteers. That’s why we have introduced a recognition scheme that helps us ensure everyone gets the credit they deserve.

If you complete at least 10 tasks, you will receive a letter from us with stickers, a pen and a pin badge. The more tasks you complete, the better the rewards – you can get a t-shirt, a magazine subscription or even a Raspberry Pi if you are exceptionally committed to our efforts.

The recognition scheme changes with time because we continually improve it. If you'd like to know more, please ask on Slack or send us an email.
