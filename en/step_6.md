## Recognition scheme

We do our best to show appreciation to our amazing volunteers. That’s why we have introduced a recognition scheme that helps us ensure everyone gets the credit they deserve.

If you complete at least 10 tasks, you will receive a letter from us with stickers, a pen and a pin badge. The more tasks you complete, the better the rewards – you can get a t-shirt, a magazine subscription or even a Raspberry Pi for those most committed to our efforts.
